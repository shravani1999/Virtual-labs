      The software process
      <br> 
      A structured set of activities required to develop a software system
      <br>
Specification <br>
Design <br>
Validation <br>
Evolution <br>
<br>
A software process model is an abstract representation of a process. It presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.


<br> <br> <br>
Generic software process models
<br><br>
The waterfall model <br>
Separate and distinct phases of specification and development. <br>
Evolutionary development <br>
Specification, development and validation are interleaved. <br>
Component-based software engineering. <br>
The system is assembled from existing components. <br>
There are many variants of these models e.g. formal development where a waterfall-like process is used but the specification is a formal specification that is refined through several stages to an implementable design. <br><br><br>

Waterfall model phases
<br><br>
Requirements analysis and definition <br>
System and software design <br>
Implementation and unit testing <br>
Integration and system testing <br>
Operation and maintenance <br>
The main drawback of the waterfall model is the difficulty of accommodating change after the process is underway. One phase has to be complete before moving onto the next phase.
<br> <br> <br>

Waterfall model problems
<br><br>
Inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements. <br>
Therefore, this model is only appropriate when the requirements are well-understood and changes will be fairly limited during the design process. <br>
Few business systems have stable requirements. <br>
The waterfall model is mostly used for large systems engineering projects where a system is developed at several sites. <br>
<br><br>


Evolutionary development
<br><br>
Exploratory development <br>
Objective is to work with customers and to evolve a final system from an initial outline specification. Should start with well-understood requirements and add new features as proposed by the customer. <br>
Throw-away prototyping <br>
Objective is to understand the system requirements. Should start with poorly understood requirements to clarify what is really needed.
<br><br><br>

Evolutionary development
<br><br>
Problems <br> 
Lack of process visibility. <br> 
Systems are often poorly structured. <br>
Special skills (e.g. in languages for rapid prototyping) may be required. <br>
<br>
Applicability
<br>
For small or medium-size interactive systems <br>
For parts of large systems (e.g. the user interface) <br>
For short-lifetime systems.
<br><br> <br>

Component-based software engineering
<br><br>
Based on systematic reuse where systems are integrated from existing components or COTS (Commercial-off-the-shelf) systems.
<br>
Process stages <br>
Component analysis <br>
Requirements modification <br>
System design with reuse <br>
Development and integration <br>
This approach is becoming increasingly used as component standards have emerged.

            Process activities
            <br><br>
            Software specification <br>
Software design and implementation <br>
Software validation <br>
Software evolution

<br><br>
Software specification
<br><br>
The process of establishing what services are required and the constraints on the systemâ€™s operation and development. <br>
Requirements engineering process <br>
Feasibility study <br>
Requirements elicitation and analysis <br>
Requirements specification <br>
Requirements validation. <br><br>
<br>
Software design and implementation <br>
<br>
The process of converting the system specification into an executable system.
<br>
Software design <br>
Design a software structure that realises the specification <br>
Implementation <br>
Translate this structure into an executable program <br>
The activities of design and implementation are closely related and may be inter-leaved. <br> <br>
<br>

Design process activities
<br><br>
Architectural design <br>
Abstract specification <br>
Interface design <br>
Component design <br>
Data structure design <br>
Algorithm design <br>
<br> <br>
<br>

Structured methods
<br>
<br>
Systematic approaches to developing a software design. <br>
The design is usually documented as a set of graphical models. <br>
Possible models <br>
Object model <br>
Sequence model <br>
State transition model <br>
Structural model <br>
Data-flow model <br>
