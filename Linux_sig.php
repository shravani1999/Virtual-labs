      process
      <br> <br>
      A program/command when executed, a special instance is provided by the system to the process. This instance consists of all the services/resources that may be utilized by the process under execution.
<br> <br>
Whenever a command is issued in unix/linux, it creates/starts a new process. For example, pwd when issued which is used to list the current directory location the user is in, a process starts.
Through a 5 digit ID number unix/linux keeps account of the processes, this number is call process id or pid. Each process in the system has a unique pid.
Used up pidâ€™s can be used in again for a newer process since all the possible combinations are used.
At any point of time, no two processes with the same pid exist in the system because it is the pid that Unix uses to track each process.
  <br> <br>
signal
<br> <br>
Signals are software interrupts sent to a program to indicate that an important event has occurred. The events can vary from user requests to illegal memory access errors. Some signals, such as the interrupt signal, indicate that a user has asked the program to do something that is not in the usual flow of control.

            A process can be run in two ways:

Foreground Process : Every process when started runs in foreground by default, receives input from the keyboard and sends output to the screen.
When issuing pwd command
<br> <br>
When a command/process is running in the foreground and is taking a lot of time, no other processes can be run or started because the prompt would not be available until the program finishes processing and comes out.
<br> <br>
            
Backround Process : It runs in the background without keyboard input and waits till keyboard input is required. Thus, other processes can be done in parallel with the process running in background since they do not have to wait for the previous process to be completed.
Adding & along with the command starts it as a background process
<br> <br>

Fields described by ps are described as:
<br> <br>
UID: User ID that this process belongs to (the person running it) <br> <br>
PID: Process ID <br> <br>
PPID: Parent process ID (the ID of the process that started it) <br> <br>
C: CPU utilization of process <br> <br>
STIME: Process start time <br> <br>
TTY: Terminal type associated with the process <br> <br>
TIME: CPU time taken by the process <br> <br>
CMD: The command that started this process <br> <br>
<br>
Signals
<br>
<br>
There are several methods of delivering signals to a program or script. One of the most common is for a user to type CONTROL-C or the INTERRUPT key while a script is executing.

When you press the Ctrl+C key, a SIGINT is sent to the script and as per defined default action script terminates.
